# Checks a migrations directory (default: server/migrations) for what CI rejects and PostgreSQL cannot see: squawk's
# findings, and the release rules against origin/dev, where a merged migration counts as released. A released
# migration and its upgrade fixtures (fixtures/<migration>.*) are never edited, renamed or deleted; a new migration is
# numbered above the newest released one; and a release branch (the pull request's target or the current branch is
# release/*) only carries migrations identical to main's.
#
# --renumber moves the new migrations and their fixtures above the newest released one first, keeping their order:
# run it after rebasing onto main, which is how migration numbers are assigned at merge time.

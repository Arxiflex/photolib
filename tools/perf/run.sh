# Measures the budgets of budgets.json this machine can measure and checks them (perf.py): the server, and the desktop
# app over every fixture. On Linux without a display the app runs under Xvfb as the `headless` target. With
# PERF_HISTORY=<file>.jsonl, a reference machine records the run there per commit, fails a regression over 10% and
# writes the dashboard to <file>.html. With PERF_FAILED=<file>, the series that fail are written there, and a run that
# finds some there (the gate's rerun of a failed run) measures and checks those alone, so that another budget cannot
# fail it. Each benchmark app runs under `perf.py watch`, which records each result the app prints as it comes, fails
# its budget as hung once it falls silent or misses a fixture's deadline, or with its status once it fails, and goes on.
# The server's benchmarks run beside the app's idle CPU, the app's frame-timed benchmarks and its cold start alone
# after them; the time each step took ends the output (ADR-0212). Needs python3, cargo, flutter, the PostgreSQL
# programs, FFmpeg (tools/video/ffmpeg.sh) for the videos the viewer swipes through, and on Linux xvfb-run and libmpv,
# and without a session bus dbus-run-session and gnome-keyring-daemon (keyring.sh).
